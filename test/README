TileDB Testing Framework

We use the Google Test C++ framework for unit testing TileDB.
The framework provide testing fixtures which are a great way
to minimize duplicate code across multiple unit tests regularly
observed in various software projects. Please refer to code
in 'src' directory for further details.

Prerequisites
You must have Google Test dynamic shared objects installed
for TileDB tests to work. If you do not have it installed,
please clone the source code from their Github repo and
compile with dynamic library turned on:
  $ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .
  $ make

Make sure both libgtest.so and libgtest_main.so are in the
link path. If not, add it to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable. Also, ensure that the Google Test
path specified in the INCLUDE_PATHS in the parent TileDB
Makefile matches with the dynamic shared library versions
specified in the link path.

To compile with TileDB with tests use:
$ make test

Troubleshooting
If you see undefined reference errors while linking with
Google Test shared objects, please check the versions of
Google Test paths declared in INCLUDE_PATHS and link path.
